        with a penchant for crafting robust back-end solutions and a keen interest in front-end development. As a computer scientist,
        I've embarked on a journey through the ever-evolving landscape of computer software technology. Currently, I work as a web developer at Alltech Consulting,
        where I've had the occasion of improving my skills in fullstack web development. My focus primarily revolves around back-end development,
        where I architect and optimize the logic that powers the web applications we interact with daily.</p>

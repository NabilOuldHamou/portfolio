# Nabil Ould Hamou - Portfolio
To visit my website [click here](https://nabilouldhamou.netlify.app/) !

I made this website as I needed to update my old site that was made in vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript and I also used this occasion to use [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and learn how to use it.


## Running locally

Start by cloning this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nabilouldhamou/portfolio
```
then install the needed dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

and use this command to run the website locally in dev mode

```bash
npm run dev
```
